By doing this I'm also taking the advice of [@ToJans](https://twitter.com/ToJans) in [his presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UPhDh_5HpjAQBVrpqzu1--qEYuFB1iUh5vOAYVIADts/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.p) at the [IDDD Tour](http://idddtour.com/) in Belgium and started a blog.  
We'll see.
